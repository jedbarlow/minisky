# Minisky

Minisky is a minimal client of the Bluesky (ATProto) API. It provides a simple API client class that you can use to log in to the Bluesky API and make any GET and POST requests there. It's meant to be an easy way to start playing and experimenting with the AT Protocol API.


## Installation

To use Minisky, you need a reasonably new version of Ruby (2.6+). Such version should be preinstalled on macOS Big Sur and above and some Linux systems. Otherwise, you can install one using tools such as [RVM](https://rvm.io), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com), [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) or [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build), or `rpm` or `apt-get` on Linux.

To install the Minisky gem, run the command:

    [sudo] gem install minisky

Or alternatively, add it to the `Gemfile` file for Bundler:

    gem 'minisky', '~> 0.1'


## Usage

First, you need to create a `.yml` config file (by default, `bluesky.yml`) with the authentication data. It should look like this:

```yaml
ident: my.bsky.username
pass: very-secret-password
```

It's recommended that you use the "app password" that you can create in the settings instead of your main account password. After you log in, this file will also be used to store your access & request tokens and DID.

Next, create the Minisky client instance, passing the server name (at the moment there is only one server at `bsky.social`, but there will be more once federation support goes live):

```rb
require 'minisky'

bsky = Minisky.new('bsky.social')
bsky.check_access
```

`check_access` will check if an access token is saved, if not - it will log you in using the login & password, otherwise it will check if the token is still valid and refresh it if needed.

Now, you can make requests to the Bluesky API using `get_request` and `post_request`:

```rb
bsky.get_request('com.atproto.repo.listRecords', {
  repo: bsky.my_did,
  collection: 'app.bsky.feed.like'
}, bsky.access_token)

bsky.post_request('com.atproto.repo.createRecord', {
  repo: bsky.my_did,
  collection: 'app.bsky.feed.post',
  record: {
    text: "Hello world!",
    createdAt: Time.now.iso8601
  }
}, bsky.access_token)
```

You can also use `#fetch_all` to load multiple paginated responses and collect all returned items on a single list (you need to pass the name of the field that contains the items in the response). Optionally, you can also specify a break condition when fetching should be stopped, e.g. to fetch all of your posts from the last 30 days, but not earlier:

```rb
time_limit = Time.now - 86400 * 30
bsky.fetch_all('com.atproto.repo.listRecords',
  { repo: bsky.my_did, collection: 'app.bsky.feed.post' },
  bsky.access_token,
  field: 'records',
  break_when: ->(x) { Time.parse(x['value']['createdAt']) < time_limit })
```


## Customization

When creating the `Minisky` instance, you can pass a name of the YAML config file to use instead of the default:

```rb
bsky = Minisky.new('bsky.social', 'config/access.yml')
```

Alternatively, instead of using the `Minisky` class, you can make your own class that includes the `Minisky::Requests` module and provides a different way to load & save the config, e.g. from a JSON file:

```rb
class BlueskyClient
  include Minisky::Requests

  def initialize(config_file)
    @config_file = config_file
    @config = JSON.parse(File.read(@config_file))
  end

  def host
    'bsky.social'
  end

  def save_config
    File.write(@config_file, JSON.pretty_generate(@config))
  end
end
```

It can then be used just like the `Minisky` class:

```rb
bsky = BlueskyClient.new('config/access.json')
bsky.check_access
bsky.get_request(...)
```
